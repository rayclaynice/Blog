#search functionalities
def search_results(request):
    # Get the search query from the request's GET parameters, defaulting to an empty string if not present.
    search_query = request.GET.get('q', '')
    if search_query:
        # If a search query is present, filter the Article objects based on whether the query is contained
        # in the title, sub_title, preview, or content fields. The `select_related` method is used to optimize
        # database access by fetching related `author` and `profile` objects in a single query.
        searches = Article.objects.filter(
            Q(title__icontains=search_query) |
            Q(sub_title__icontains=search_query) |
            Q(preview__icontains=search_query) |
            Q(content__icontains=search_query)
        ).select_related('author__profile')
    else:
        # If no search query is present, return an empty QuerySet.
        searches = Article.objects.none()
  If a search query is present, the function filters the Article objects based on whether the query is contained in the title, sub_title, preview, or content fields. The select_related method is used to optimize database access by fetching related author and profile objects in a single query. If no search query is provided, an empty QuerySet is returned.

    # Initialize an empty list to hold the search results.
    results = []
    # Iterate over the filtered articles and build a dictionary for each one, 
    # including relevant details like title, preview, content, sub_title, and author information.
    for search in searches:
        results.append({
            'title': search.title,
            'preview': search.preview,
            'content': search.content,
            'sub_title': search.sub_title,
            'author': {
                'username': search.author.username,
                'profile': {
                    'image': {
                        'url': search.author.profile.image.url
                    }
                }
            }
        })
The function initializes an empty list called results to hold the search results. It iterates over the filtered articles (searches) and builds a dictionary for each article, including relevant details such as the title, preview, content, sub_title, and author information.
    # Initialize an empty list to hold data for all articles.
    articles_data = []
    # Fetch all articles from the database.
    articles = Article.objects.all()
    # Iterate over all articles and build a dictionary for each one,
    # including author username, author profile image URL, and the formatted creation date.
    for item in articles:
        articles_data.append({
            'author': item.author.username,
            'author_image_url': item.author.profile.image.url,
            'created_at': item.get_date(),
        })
    # Initialize an empty list to hold data for all articles.
    articles_data = []
    # Fetch all articles from the database.
    articles = Article.objects.all()
    # Iterate over all articles and build a dictionary for each one,
    # including author username, author profile image URL, and the formatted creation date.
    for item in articles:
        articles_data.append({
            'author': item.author.username,
            'author_image_url': item.author.profile.image.url,
            'created_at': item.get_date(),
        })
Additionally, the function initializes another empty list called articles_data to hold data for all articles. It fetches all articles from the database and iterates over them, building a dictionary for each article that includes the author’s username, the author’s profile image URL, and the formatted creation date.
    # Return a JSON response containing the search results, all articles data, and the original search query.
    return JsonResponse({
        'searches': results,
        'articles': articles_data,
        'search_query': search_query
    })
Finally, the function returns a JSON response containing the search results (results), all articles data (articles_data), and the original search query (search_query).
